Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the products of the
corresponding entries of the two vectors.
(used this in the function)

Geometrically, it is the product of the Euclidean magnitudes of
the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.
A·B = ||A|| ||B|| cos(θ)
where ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of the vectors,
and θ is the angle between the vectors.

These definitions are equivalent when using Cartesian point.

Cosine in rel. to angle between vectors:
	-	0 deg: cosine is 1
	-	180 deg: cosine is -1
	-	90 deg: cosine is 0

Dotprod depends on angle (deg) between vectors:
	> 0 && < 90		positive
	== 90			0
	> 90 && < 180	negative
